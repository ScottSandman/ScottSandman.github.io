The first post of my recently constructed blog. How did we get here? It all started a couple weeks ago in JRS Code School video class session (pandemic and all). &lt;a href=&quot;https://robertwpearce.com/&quot;&gt;Robert Pearce&lt;/a&gt;, a Senior Software Engineer, took some time out of his day to speak with us prospective developers. One of the items he touched on during our discussion was &quot;learning in public&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about what he meant by learning in public for a few days and was having a tough time wrapping my head around what it meant. Was I suppose to be on Facebook and Twitter all the time? I&apos;m not, by the way. So I reach out to Robert and asked. He responded with &quot;This will tell you everything you need to know: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/&quot;&gt;https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/&lt;/a&gt; &quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, I clicked on the link and gained a much better understanding of what it meant to &quot;learn in public&quot;. It was something real and tangible and not just toodling around on social media. One of the first items on the list was to start a blog and discuss what I have been learning. Simple enough. I&apos;ve written blogs before. But where to start? Should I use my knowledge of MongoDB and Api&apos;s? We did just do a Travel Blog using those tools in class. I was having a difficult time figuring out how I was going to properly format the blog object when I passed it back into the HTML. I didn&apos;t really want it to be lumped all together and it didn&apos;t seem logical to have to write new JavaScript with each blog to format it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I reached out to Robert, again. Robert&apos;s response, &quot;Start with HTML and CSS only and work your way up to using GatsbyJS.&quot; That&apos;s a quality plan. However, Robert doesn&apos;t really know me. You mention Gatsby to me once and it goes on my list of things to read about and eventually learn. Mention it twice and with the lure of working my way up to it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I sat down to build a blog. Yes, using Gatsby. I found a tutorial online offered by Gatsby and I dug in. I should mention here that they also have a starter blog that you can clone from Github. That&apos;s not my style. A few hours in and I had broken it. The Blog that is. Errors everywhere. I&apos;m pretty certain I deleted some files and code I wasn&apos;t suppose to. Anyway, back to square one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took to Google again and that&apos;s when I found this tutorial by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ultimatecourses.com/blog/building-a-blog-with-gatsby-and-graphql&quot;&gt;Emma Bostian&lt;/a&gt;. Attempt number two was successful, obviously. But not only that, Emma did a really nice job of explaining ways to use GraphQl to set up your queries and handle your data. She didn&apos;t just show the code and explain it. She took the tutorial into GraphIQL and demonstrated how to build the queries. Kudos, Emma, that was very helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, what did I learn in the past two days? Well, I reacquainted myself with ReactJS. It had been almost a year since I last worked on a project with it. Timing couldn&apos;t have been better as we are starting the React portion of our class this week. I learned that React with Gatsby and with GraphQL can make putting together a blog website fairly simple and eloquent. In more detail, I learned how to use my knowledge of APIs and turn them into a query. I learned how to set up those queries to be passed along into pages, and I also figured out how to navigate around in Gatsby a little bit. I liked it, a lot. This won&apos;t be my last adventure with it and most likely not the last time I break an app using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoyed the read. I do promise to get more technical as time goes on with actual code examples and such. I also plan on adding some more functionality to the app. In the meantime, if you have any comments or suggestions, please feel free to click on the Contact link above and shoot me an email.&lt;/p&gt;
