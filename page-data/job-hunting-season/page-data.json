Sniff</em> Smells like job hunting season. My time at JRS is coming to a close. It's been a fast paced two months and just like that we are working on final projects. Those new found skills (as well as the old ones) are getting put to the test. They are going to need to be sharp, too, given these recent economic times which have sent millions to the unemployment lines. Am I ready? That's for the potential employers to decide. My job is to continue to prepare and improve upon my skill sets and perhaps even add a few new ones.</p>\n<p>You may have noticed I did miss a few regular postings. That is because I have been doing what I stated above; preparing, studying, building a portfolio, generating new skills, fine-tuning the other ones and revamping my resume. One of the projects I have been working on is a mobile app. A local start-up here in Charleston asked for some help so I didn't hesitate. I had worked with React Native and Expo in the past (definitely rusty, though). So far I've contributed by creating some placeholder screens, set up a pseudo authorization path, implemented the navigation stack with initial routes and got the redux started for handling user data. Looking forward to doing more. Especially with React Navigation. It has been completely re-vamped since I last used it.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, it's also final project time at JRS. We started the group project yesterday and, after a slow start, got into a groove today and made some decent progress. We are building a student portal for future JRS students. The portal will have a place for assignments and resources to be posted along with an area for them to post about what they are learning (sound familiar). The client (our instructor, Mr. Casey Wilson) wanted to be sure we utilized the most skills possible so we are using Amazon Web Services Amplify framework which uses an S3 bucket to store images and documents, Dynamo to store resource postings, GraphQl as the API connecting the front end to S3 and Dynamo, RDS database for housing user profile data, Lambdas to implement REST APIs to communicate the user profile data to RDS, Cognito to handle authorization, with React carrying the front end, redux to manage the state the APIs are sending/receiving, Reach Router to get us to all that information and Material UI to make it look great. And, yes, that was a run-on. Had to channel some inner Kerouac to generate it. But that's not all. Mr. Wilson wanted to make sure we could also discuss all of the tools we are using on the project so he scheduled us to present at a local online meetup which will be attended by some of the best developers in our area. It reminds me of an interview I saw with NFL Hall of Fame kicker Morten Anderson. When asked if he ever felt pressure before any of his big kicks, he responded that he believed pressure was caused by having doubt and he never believed he couldn't make a kick. We got this.</p>\n<p>For my final project, I was true to myself and put forth a challenge that will push my skills to their limits and force me to add some new ones. I am writing a web application to assist small businesses in focusing their advertising on local clientele. Their are over 400,000 non-employer and small firms (under 20 employees) in South Carolina. They employ a large part of our work force and are responsible for a pretty good sized chunk of our job growth. We need them back on their feet as-soon-as possible. Any little bit I can do to help is well worth it.</p>\n<p>The project is just coming out of the conceptual stage so I am still in the process of designing the architecture. The only things for certain are geo location services will be used and I will use React to frame up the front end. Hopefully, I will have some time next week to go into more detail. I do need to give a big shout out to Mr. Daniel Stern at the Harbor Entrepreneur Center. Mr Stern has gone out of his way to reach out to his small business contacts in hopes of having them beta test the application at the final presentation. Can't thank him enough.</p>\n<p>That's all I have time for today, but I will leave you with an interesting question I came across applying for a job today. One of the questions they asked along with the resume submittal was \"What makes you unique?\" I won't tell you what I wrote, but I will ask the same of you. Gotta love the round pegs in the square holes.</p>"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"image":"/src/images/ravenel.jpg","siteUrl":"https://scottsandman.github.io"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
