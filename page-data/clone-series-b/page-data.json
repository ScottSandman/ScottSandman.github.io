It seems that has turned out to be a false start resulting in a five yard penalty. I was premature in trying to fit the clone project into my schedule. I did start the project and got a couple of days into planning and set-up before I realized I had quite a bit more to do in preparing for my volunteer teaching gig with Microsoft TEALS. I also felt I needed to be spending more time studying for the AWS Certification and then a job opportunity came about leading to research on the company and a bunch of interview prep (both for initial phone and in-person meetings). And then I lost most of a day at the doctors office dealing with a nagging back injury. I know. I get it. That's why I threw the flag on myself.</p>\n<p>I've backed up the five yards, surveyed the defense and am now calling an audible. I hope to return to the clone some time next week, but that is dependent on how they respond to the last job interview. Turns out I may have secured a job and, afterall, that is the end goal. Until next time, stay healthy and safe.</p>"},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"image":"../src/images/ravenel.jpg","siteUrl":"https://scottsandman.github.io"}}},"pageContext":{}}}
