A quick update before we get started. Since graduating from JRS, I attended my daughter's wedding in SLC. Wedding was great. Travel to and from, not so much. Upon returning to Charleston, I have been networking, taking classes and viewing talks on egghead, testing my skills at PluralSight (expert in Express.js and proficient in 7 other skills), and preparing to take the AWS Certified Developer Certification. AWS recommends working with their services for roughly a year before taking the certification. I'm not that patient and have set a goal of 6 months. I'll keep you posted on how that goes.</p>\n<p>Now, on to today's topic: I'm building a clone of Slack. Why? To keep building my skills, of course, and it seems like a solid challenge. I still have some architecture decisions to make, but going with my mainstay MERN stack and I'll throw some AWS services like Cognito, S3, and Lambda. I am definitely looking to go serverless and, to that end, am looking into utilizing a micro services approach.</p>\n<p>The plan as it stands now is to post weekly updates on my progress and what I've learned along the way. However, given the scope of the project, I think it's likely there will be weeks when there are multiple posts and also times when I get hung up on some tech and it takes some time to work through. Whatever the case, there's a project, there's a plan, and there will be some posts. Hope you can join me for the duration. Until next time, stay healthy.</p>"}},"pageContext":{}}}
